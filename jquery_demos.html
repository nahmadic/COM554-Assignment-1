            <p>A drum kit (primarily US English), drum set (primarily UK & Australian English),[1] trap set, or just drums is a collection of drums and other percussion instruments set up to be played/struck by a single player. A musician who plays a drum
              kit is called a drummer[2]</p>

            <p>The traditional drum kit consists of a mix of drums (classified as classically as membranophones, Hornbostel-Sachs high-level classification 2) and idiophones (Hornbostel-Sachs high-level classification 1, most significantly cymbals but also
              including the woodblock and cowbell for example).[3] More recently kits have also included electronic instruments (Hornbostel-Sachs classification 53), with both hybrid and entirely electronic kits now in common use.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="tab-content" id="tab2">
            <p>Cymbals are a common percussion instrument. Cymbals consist of thin, normally round plates of various alloys. The majority of cymbals are of indefinite pitch, although small disc-shaped cymbals based on ancient designs sound a definite note
              (see: crotales). Cymbals are used in many ensembles ranging from the orchestra, percussion ensembles, jazz bands, heavy metal bands, and marching groups. Drum kits usually incorporate at least a crash, ride or crash/ride, and a pair of hi-hat
              cymbals.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="tab-content" id="tab3">
            <p> Drum hardware refers to the parts of a drum or drum kit that are used to tension, position, and otherwise support the instruments themselves. Occasionally, the hardware is used percussively as well, the most common example being a rim shot.
              John Morrison is noted for his drum solos played entirely on a hi-hat stand (and occasionally also on other parts of the kit hardware, adjacent furniture, and audience).</p>

            A drum stick is a type of percussion mallet used particularly for playing snare drum, drum kit and some other percussion instruments, and particularly for playing unpitched percussion.

            <p>Specialized beaters used on some other percussion instruments, such as the metal beater or wand used with a triangle, and particularly beaters or mallets used with tuned percussion such as xylophone and timpani, are not normally referred to
              as drum sticks.</p>

        <h1>Drummers</h1>
      </div>
      <div id="top-right-content">
        <p>A drummer is a musician who plays drums, which includes a drum kit ("drum set" or "trap set", including cymbals) and accessory-based hardware which includes an assortment of pedals and standing support mechanisms, marching percussion or any musical
          instrument that is struck within the context of a wide assortment of musical genres. The term percussionist applies to a musician who performs struck musical instruments of numerous diverse shapes, sizes and applications. Most contemporary western
          ensembles bands for rock, pop, jazz, R&B etc. include a drummer for purposes including timekeeping. Most drummers of this particular designation work within the context of a larger contingent (aka rhythm section) that may also include, keyboard
          (a percussion instrument) or guitar, auxiliary percussion (often of non western origin) and bass (bass viol or electric). Said ensembles may also include melodic based mallet percussion including: vibraphone, marimba or xylophone. The rhythm
          section, being the core metronomic foundation with which other melodic instruments, including voices, may present the harmonic/melodic portion of the material.</p>

        <p>First and foremost, a drummer is a musician that performs music on the multi-percussion instrument known as the drum set, which usually consists of a bass drum (with pedal), a floor tom, tom-toms, a snare drum, hi-hats, a ride cymbal, and a crash
          cymbal.
        </p>

        <p>In popular music, the primary function of the drummer is to "keep time" or provide a steady tempo and rhythmic foundation. However, in other musical styles, such as world, jazz, classical, and electronica, the function of a drummer is often shifted
          from "time keeper" to soloist, whereby the main melody becomes the rhythmic development generated by the drummer or percussionist.</p>

        <p>There are many tools that a drummer can use for either timekeeping or soloing. These include cymbals (china, crash, ride, splash, hi-hats, etc.), snare, toms, auxiliary percussion (bells, Latin drums, cowbells, temple blocks) and many others.
          Also there are single, double, and triple bass pedals for the bass drum.</p>

          <div class="accordion-content">
            <p>Learning to play drums requires a lot of memorization and practice. The goal is to develop your skills to a point where you no longer have to think about technique , so that you can execute parts freely. It can take years to develop, but a
              good teacher can guide you through the fundamentals so that you will progress more quickly. The more you play, the better you will be.</p>

            <p>Most drummers do not have drum endorsements. Product endorsers are usually high-profile drummers whose name and reputation can help a company market percussion products. Most companies have adopted a tiered system in which many drummers pay
              a reduced rate while the minority receives free equipment. Very few endorsers are paid to play a companys products, although most are expected to appear in advertising, give testimonials, make public appearances, and/or fly the companys
